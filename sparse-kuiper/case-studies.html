                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>A mid-sized manufacturing company was losing skilled workers at an alarming rate. Exit interviews consistently failed to surface the real reasons — employees cited "better opportunities" but the pattern suggested deeper systemic issues. Management had tried salary increases and team-building events, but turnover kept rising.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>What We Did</h3>
                    <p>We conducted a full Corporate Wellness Audit: anonymous employee surveys (with a 78% participation rate), leadership interviews, and a review of shift patterns, leave policies, and workload distribution. The data revealed that burnout — not compensation — was the primary driver. Supervisors had never been trained to recognise it, and the company's leave policy effectively penalised employees who used mental health days.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                    <p>The organisation implemented our recommendations: restructured shift rotations, introduced a no-questions-asked mental health day policy, and enrolled all supervisors in our burnout recognition workshop. Within six months, staff turnover dropped by 38% and absenteeism fell by 22%.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>A regional bank's performance KPIs were being met, but quietly, sick leave was rising, internal complaints were increasing, and two senior managers left within the same quarter. The organisation assumed it was a compensation issue. Their internal survey — designed by a consulting firm in Geneva — returned no useful insights because the questions didn't map to the actual work culture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>What We Did</h3>
                    <p>We delivered a series of three workshops over eight weeks: one for senior leadership, one for middle management, and one for front-line staff. Each was tailored. For leaders, we focused on the cost of presenteeism and how to read team data differently. For managers, it was burnout recognition and having honest conversations. For staff, it was understanding stress biology and building personal boundaries in a high-pressure environment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                    <p>Post-workshop surveys showed that 67% of managers could now identify early burnout signs (vs. 12% before). The bank subsequently developed an internal wellness committee and engaged us for quarterly check-ins.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>An international NGO operating in Kenya faced a paradox: its mission was community wellbeing, but its own staff were burning out. Field workers were dealing with secondary trauma daily but had zero access to mental health support during working hours. "Debriefs" happened informally over drinks. The organisation's donor-facing reporting showed smiling photos — the internal reality was exhaustion, cynicism, and compassion fatigue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>What We Did</h3>
                    <p>We entered into a 12-month advisory partnership. Phase 1 was an anonymised audit of staff wellbeing — the results were so stark that the executive director called an emergency board meeting. Phase 2 was monthly group processing sessions for field teams, combined with individual burnout risk assessments. Phase 3 was policy development — we helped them create a formal staff wellness policy that the board ratified, including mandatory decompression days after intensive fieldwork and dedicated counselling access during working hours.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-section">
                    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                    <p>Staff-reported stress levels dropped by 45% over the year. More importantly, retention improved significantly — field staff who would previously have left within 18 months were now averaging 30+ months. The policy they developed has since been shared with three partner organisations as a template.</p>
