## The Science Behind It

### Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)
The MBI is the most widely used tool for measuring burnout, developed by Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson. It has been validated across **50+ years of research** and thousands of studies worldwide.

**Our adaptation:**
- Uses 6 core questions that capture the three MBI dimensions
- Simplified for quick screening (full MBI is 22 items)
- Culturally adapted for the Kenyan workplace context

### AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Developer**: Google DeepMind
- **Capabilities**:
  - Advanced natural language understanding
  - Contextual emotion detection
  - Multi-turn conversational memory
- **Safety**: Configured with strict parameters to avoid medical diagnosis and always recommend professional help for severe cases

## Ethical Considerations
