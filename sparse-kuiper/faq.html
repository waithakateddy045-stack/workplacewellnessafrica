                <summary>What exactly does Workplace Wellness Africa do?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We work with organisations across Kenya and East Africa to build healthier, more productive
                        workplaces. Our services include <strong>corporate wellness audits</strong>, <strong>employee
                            mental health training</strong>, <strong>leadership workshops</strong>, and <strong>policy
                            advisory</strong>. We also provide educational resources through our free article library —
                        covering burnout, work-life balance, toxic leadership, financial stress, and more.</p>
                    <p>Revenue from our consulting services directly funds our charitable work: fighting mental health
                        stigma and advocating for humane workplace policies.</p>

                    <p>We serve two audiences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Organisations:</strong> HR teams, business leaders, and corporate decision-makers
                            who want to improve employee wellbeing, reduce turnover, and build healthier workplace
                            cultures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Individuals:</strong> Working professionals who want to better understand burnout,
                            set boundaries, navigate toxic environments, or simply improve their mental health at work.
                        </li>

                        healthcare, technology, and government. Workplace stress doesn't discriminate by industry, and
                        neither do we. Our programmes are always customised to fit the unique challenges of each

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. While we are headquartered in Kenya, we serve organisations across East Africa and are
                        expanding to other African markets. Our workshops and training can be delivered in-person or
                        virtually, making it easy to work with teams in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and beyond.</p>
